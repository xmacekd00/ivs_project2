We were working with the wrong deadline for about a month, so afterwards the deadlines had to be completely rescheduled.
Sometimes the task distribution was not ideal. Some task could not be completed early on because they depended on the 
completion of something else.
The time estimates for some tasks were also too long due to a lack of familiarity with the topic 
Despite these complications, the team demonstrated exceptional cooperation and adaptability.
Through regular synchronization and workload redistribution, we maintained progress momentum and successfully compensated for initial planning discrepancies.
This collaborative approach ultimately enabled us to deliver a fully functional solution within the revised timeframe.
